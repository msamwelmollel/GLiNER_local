## Introduction
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the field of natural language processing, offering solutions to a wide array of general problems. However, these models often struggle with domain-specific tasks, emerging knowledge, and especially with issues like polysemy, homonyms, and entity ambiguity, leading to inaccurate or hallucinated responses. This project presents the enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using GLiNER, a state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool, in combination with Llama-Index and Mistral, to address these challenges effectively.

## Installation
Before you start, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip for Python 3
To install the required dependencies, run the following commands:

## Usage
This project involves several steps to enhance the RAG system, including entity recognition, query refinement, and leveraging LLMs for improved performance. Follow these steps to set up and use the system:

Step 1: Setup GLiNER
Clone the GLiNER repository or install it via HuggingFace:
