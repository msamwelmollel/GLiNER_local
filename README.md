## Introduction
The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly impacted the field of natural language processing, offering solutions to a wide array of general problems. However, these models often struggle with domain-specific tasks, emerging knowledge, and especially with issues like polysemy, homonyms, and entity ambiguity, leading to inaccurate or hallucinated responses. This project introduces a novel approach to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using GLiNER, a state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool, in combination with Llama-Index and Mistral, to address these challenges effectively.
